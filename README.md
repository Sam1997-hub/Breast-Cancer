We have used Variance Threshold for feature selection in this case and dropped the variables which are similar by 75% or more.
We have only used logistic regression(with a k fold validation of 20) in this case as it gave us 95%+ accuracy scores and an AUC of 0.99 which was pretty excellent and we chose to stick with this model and not go with any other model.
